**EulerProjectCode** - Contains a few solutions to the Project Euler Archives found [here](https://projecteuler.net/about)

## How to run
Clone this repository and then using your favourite terminal, open your folder/directory of choice (EulerProjectCode). Whilst in the directory you can run your chosen script in the terminal as follows:

`python <script-name>.py`

eg.

`python eulpy01.py`

All scripts are self contained and will print output to the command line without need for external input.

## To run Tests
For each script there is a corresponding test and to run the test you would use the following command in terminal:

`python <script-name>Test.py`

eg.

`python eulpy01Test.py`
