## Project Euler Problem 25 - https://projecteuler.net/problem=25

 The Fibonacci sequence runs as follows:
 The numbers increase by adding the latest 2 numbers in the sequence to get the next number.
 For example the sequence of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 is produced like so in a simplified view:
             1
             1
     1 + 1 = 2
     1 + 2 = 3
     2 + 3 = 5
     3 + 5 = 8
     5 + 8 = 13

 For this solution the index (term) of the first number to contain 1000 digits will be printed out
